As you will see once you start up the program, I decided to go with free camera control instead of making a movie.

This has been very exciting for me as game design is a field in which I am fairly interested. That said, this has

presented a lot of interesting challenges. I did not realize how time consuming designing a labyrinthian dungeon

would take. Here is a list of things that still need to be done-


1. There are still more walls, corridors, and hallways that I need to add. *CHECK*

2. I would like to add more monster variants aside from the floating eyeball monster that I have. *CHECK*

3. There will be more gems and warps.

4. Transparency is not currently working but I am trying to implement it on the gems.

5. There are a few normals that still need calculation on the brain monsters. *CHECK*

6. Do you have any suggestions for what you would like to see? Am I headed on the right track? (Collision detection for walls. *CHECK*)

7. Slow down movement speed

8. Enable lights by default

9. Enable fog
